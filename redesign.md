# North Shore Run Club Website Modernization Plan

## Current Website Analysis

### Performance Issues
1. **Poor LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: 57.8 seconds is extremely high (should be under 2.5s)
2. **Large image sizes**: Total size is over 11MB, with most being unoptimized images
3. **No text compression**: Affecting load times
4. **High JS execution time**: The weather API call is blocking

### Accessibility Issues
1. **Color contrast issues**: The cyan text (#00ffff) on magenta background (#ff00ff) has insufficient contrast (2.5:1 vs required 4.5:1)
2. **Image aspect ratio problems**: Several images are being displayed with incorrect aspect ratios

### SEO Issues
1. **Missing meta description**: Hurting search engine visibility
2. **No structured data**: Limited search engine understanding of content

### Design Observations
1. **Retro 80s/90s aesthetic**: Neon colors, monospace font, glowing borders
2. **Simple layout**: Single page with sections
3. **Inline CSS**: All styling is in the head of the document
4. **Limited interactivity**: Just weather API integration
5. **No responsive design**: Not optimized for different screen sizes

## Modernization Plan with Next.js

### Step 1: Set Up Next.js Project Structure

1. Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up project folders following Next.js app router convention:
   - `/app`: Main application routes
   - `/app/page.tsx`: Homepage
   - `/components`: Reusable UI components
   - `/lib`: Utility functions and shared code
   - `/public`: Static assets
3. Install necessary dependencies:
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Next.js Image component for image optimization
   - React Icons for modern iconography
   - Framer Motion for subtle animations

### Step 2: Preserve the Retro Aesthetic while Modernizing

1. Create a custom Tailwind theme that maintains the neon/retro feel:
   - Keep the magenta/cyan color scheme but adjust for accessibility
   - Use custom fonts that evoke retro feel but improve readability
   - Implement accessible neon glow effects with proper contrast ratios
2. Create reusable components for UI elements:
   - NeonBox component for the glowing borders
   - RetroButton component for CTA buttons
   - InfoCard component for the information boxes

### Step 3: Improve Performance

1. Optimize images:
   - Convert all PNGs to WebP or AVIF format
   - Implement Next.js Image component with proper sizes
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
2. Improve weather API implementation:
   - Move API call to server-side with SWR for client-side revalidation
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Add caching with revalidation strategy
3. Implement proper font loading and optimization:
   - Use Next.js font optimization
   - Consider variable fonts for performance

### Step 4: Enhance UX/UI

1. Implement responsive design:
   - Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
   - Optimize navigation for small screens
   - Ensure touch targets are appropriate for mobile
2. Add subtle animations:
   - Entrance animations for sections as they scroll into view
   - Hover effects for interactive elements
   - Loading states for async operations
3. Improve information architecture:
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Improved readability with proper text sizing and spacing
   - Consistent UI patterns
