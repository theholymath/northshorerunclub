# North Shore Pub Run Website Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the steps to improve the North Shore Pub Run website's design and user experience.

## Problem Statement
The current website effectively communicates the run club's purpose and information but feels visually overwhelming. The goal is to maintain the fun aesthetic while improving clarity, organization, and overall user experience.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simplify Visual Design ✅
- [x] Reduce neon color palette to 2-3 primary colors (cyan and pink as main, with a neutral accent)
- [x] Standardize border treatments across all cards (consistent styles, thickness, and glow effects)
- [x] Remove excessive animations (limit to 1-2 key elements only)
- [x] Increase whitespace between sections for better visual separation
- [x] Create consistent card styling across the site

### Phase 2: Improve Information Hierarchy ✅
- [x] Consolidate redundant information (especially joining instructions that appear multiple times)
- [x] Emphasize critical information (date, time, location) with visual priority
- [x] Create clearer section headers that stand out from content
- [x] Remove or archive outdated information (past events, old dates)
- [x] Ensure the most important information appears "above the fold"

### Phase 3: Typography Refinement
- [ ] Establish consistent text sizes for headings (h1, h2, h3) and body text
- [ ] Improve text contrast for better readability
- [ ] Reduce variety of font styles (limit to 2-3 font families maximum)
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing between text elements
- [ ] Add emphasis only to the most important text elements

### Phase 4: Content Organization
- [ ] Reorganize content into logical groupings (event details, routes, about us)
- [ ] Simplify the hero section to focus on next run details
- [ ] Make route information more usable with clearer maps and descriptions
- [ ] Add social proof elements (consider adding actual photos of runners)
- [ ] Create a more structured information flow from most to least important

### Phase 5: Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Test and adjust layouts for mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure readability on smaller screens (appropriate font sizes)
- [ ] Simplify navigation for mobile users
- [ ] Optimize images for faster loading on mobile
- [ ] Test interactive elements for touch usability

### Phase 6: Add Final Touches
- [ ] Enhance call-to-action elements with clear visual priority
- [ ] Add social media integration if applicable
- [ ] Final testing and refinement across devices
- [ ] Add any missing information identified during the refactoring process
- [ ] Get feedback from actual users and implement final adjustments

## Design Principles to Follow
1. **Clarity over decoration** - While maintaining the fun neon aesthetic, ensure that information is always clear and readable
2. **Consistent visual language** - Use the same visual treatments for similar elements
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Present the most important information first, with details available as needed
4. **Purposeful design choices** - Every color, animation, and style should serve a specific purpose

## Success Metrics
- Reduced visual clutter
- Clearer information hierarchy
- Improved readability
- Maintained fun and energetic aesthetic
- Effective communication of key run club information
- Mobile-friendly experience

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify Visual Design (Completed)
- Reduced the neon color palette to primarily cyan and pink, with consistent usage
- Standardized border treatments (all borders now 2px with consistent styling)
- Removed excessive animations (keeping only the main date/time pulse animation)
- Increased whitespace between sections for better separation
- Created consistent card styling for better visual hierarchy
- Reduced the intensity of glow effects for a cleaner look

### Phase 2: Improve Information Hierarchy (Completed)
- Consolidated redundant information about meeting times and registration
- Created a dedicated "black box" highlight in the hero section for the most critical info (time, date, location)
- Reorganized content into logical sections with clear descriptive headers
- Removed duplicate date/time mentions that appeared in multiple sections
- Structured content in a progressive disclosure pattern (most important first)
- Improved the schedule display with a clear two-column layout
- Enhanced route information with descriptive labels
- Moved the weather widget to its own dedicated section

This plan will be implemented step by step, with regular reviews to ensure we're maintaining the core personality of the site while improving its usability.
